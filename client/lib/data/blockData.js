            a tangible reality. Whether your idea is an action or a physical creation, 
            bringing it to life will likely involve the hard work of iteration, testing, 
            and refinement. Just be wary of perfectionism. Push yourself to share your creations 
            with others. By maintaining an open stance, you’ll be able to learn from their feedback. 
            Consider their responses new material that you can draw from the next time you’re embarking 
            on a creative endeavor.`,
