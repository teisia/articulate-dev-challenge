            released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records. Named after the location of EMI Studios 
            in London, the cover features the group walking across the street's zebra crossing, an 
            image that became one of the most famous and imitated in popular music. The album's 
            initially mixed reviews were contrasted by its immediate commercial success, topping 
            record charts in the UK and US. The lead single "Something" / "Come Together" was released 
            in October and topped US charts.`,

        "tabContent": `Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. 
            It was released on 5 August 1966, accompanied by the double A-side single "Eleanor Rigby" 
            / "Yellow Submarine". The album was the Beatles' final recording project before their 
            retirement as live performers and marked the group's most overt use of studio technology 
            to date, building on the advances of their late 1965 release Rubber Soul. It has since 
            become regarded as one of the greatest and most innovative albums in popular music, with 
            recognition centred on its range of musical styles, diverse sounds, and lyrical content.`,

            American version of the album, issued by Capitol Records, contained ten of the fourteen songs 
            and two tracks withheld from the band's Help! album. Rubber Soul met with a highly favourable 
            critical response and topped sales charts in Britain and the United States for several weeks.`,

            band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967,[nb 1] it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record 
            Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart 
            in the United States. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in songwriting, production 
            and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for 
            reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. Its release was a defining 
            moment in 1960s pop culture, heralding the Summer of Love, while the album's reception achieved 
            full cultural legitimisation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form. 
            It won four Grammy Awards in 1968, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this 
            honour.`,

        "tabContent": `The Beatles, also known as the White Album, is the ninth studio album and only double 
            album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 22 November 1968. Its plain white sleeve 
            has no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed,[a] which was intended as a direct 
            contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. 
            The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, 
            British blues, ska, music hall and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a 
            postmodern work, as well as among the greatest albums of all time.`,
